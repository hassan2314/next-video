2. Installation
   - Clone: `git clone <repo-url>`
   - Change directory: `cd <project-dir>`
   - Install dependencies (examples):
     - Node: `npm ci` or `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile`
     - Python: `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Configuration
